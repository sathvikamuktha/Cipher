# 🔐 Cipher Hub - Encryption & Decryption App

**Cipher Hub** is a web-based cryptography tool that allows users to encrypt and decrypt messages using popular algorithms like Caesar Cipher, Vigenère Cipher and RSA. Built in just **8 hours** during **Axe Hacks 2025** by our group, this project won the **"Most Technical Hack"** award! 🎉

> Are you wondering what **Cipher** means? "Cipher is a secret or disguised way of writing a code."

- **Encryption key:** secret code used to encrypt and decrypt data
- **Caesar Cipher:** A simple encryption method where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of positions in the alphabet. The number of positions is the key.
- **RSA:** A widely used asymmetric encryption algorithm.

## 🚀 Features
- Encrypt & Decrypt messages using **Caesar Cipher** and **Vigenère Cipher**
- Generate **RSA key pairs** for secure encryption
- Simple & interactive UI powered by **Streamlit**
- Upload text files(via file upload feature) or enter messages manually

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
 - Python
 - Streamlit
 - Cryptography library
